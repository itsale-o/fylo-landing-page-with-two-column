## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to use JavaScript and email Regex to validate emails. The users will see a message on the screen if the email format is invalid.

Some of the JS code that changes what the users see depending on what kind of text is on the input box:

```js
function setError1(){
input1.style.border = '1px solid red';
span1.style.display = 'block';     
}

function removeError1(){
input1.style.border = '';
span1.style.display = 'none';
}
```

### Continued development

I never used JavaScript on my own, so this was a very interesting project to me. Despite being a very small JS code, I really learned a lot of how it works. I'd like to continue learning and improving my skills on it.
